## Working with Issues  

### Finding an Issue  

- Visit the Issues tab in the repository.  
- Look for issues tagged with `good first issue` or `help wanted`.  
- Leave a comment on the issue you'd like to work on, and a maintainer will assign it to you.  

### ‚ù§Ô∏è Our Contribution Etiquette

To ensure that everyone has a fair and positive experience, we ask all contributors to follow these guidelines. We are a community focused on providing opportunities, and these rules help us achieve that mission.

**1. Ask Before You Work**
- Please find an issue you're interested in and comment to ask for assignment **before** you start working.
- Do not work on issues that have already been assigned to someone else.

**2. Wait for Assignment**
- After commenting, please wait for a maintainer to formally assign the issue to you.
- A maintainer's assignment is the official green light to begin your work.

**3. Respect Our `women-devs-only` Issues**
- As part of our core mission to empower women in tech, some issues are labeled **`women-devs-only`**.
- **These issues are strictly reserved to give women developers an opportunity to learn and contribute in a safe, supportive space.** We kindly ask that our allies respect this policy and leave these specific issues for them.

**4. One Thing at a Time**
- To give everyone a chance, you can only be assigned **one issue at a time** across all WomenDevsSG repositories.
- Please also ensure that each Pull Request (PR) you submit solves **only one issue**. Do not bundle fixes for multiple issues into a single PR.

**We appreciate your cooperation in helping us build a fair and supportive open-source environment!**

### Creating an Issue  

If you spot a bug or have an idea that isn‚Äôt already listed:  

1. Open a new issue and use the appropriate template (e.g., Bug Report, Feature Request).  
2. Be clear and concise in your description.  
3. Wait for feedback from maintainers before proceeding.

## Setting Up Your Local Environment  

To work on an issue:  

1. Fork the repository to your GitHub account.  
2. Clone the forked repository to your local machine:  
   ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/repo-name.git  
   ```  
3. Create a new branch for your changes:  
   ```bash  
   git checkout -b your-branch-name  
   ```  
4. Follow the steps in the project‚Äôs README to set up your environment.  
5. Make your changes.  
6. Test the changes on your local environment.
7. Run `npm run test:e2e` to run the e2e (end to end) tests (Runs by default on `http://localhost:4321`, you can change it to another port in your environment variables by duplicating `.env.example` into `.env` and changing the `PLAYWRIGHT_BASE_URL` value).

## Creating a Pull Request  

Once you've completed your changes:  

1. Push your branch to your forked repository:  
   ```bash  
   git push origin your-branch-name  
   ```  
2. Open a pull request (PR) from your branch to the repository's `main` branch.

## Awaiting Review  

Once you‚Äôve submitted your PR:  

- A maintainer will review your changes. This may take some time‚Äîthank you for your patience!  
- If changes are requested, you can update your PR by pushing to the same branch.  

Remember, reviews are meant to ensure the quality and consistency of the project, not to criticize you personally.
