⚠️ FOR CONTRIBUTORS: PLEASE READ BEFORE COMMENTING ⚠️

Thank you for your interest in contributing! Before you ask to be assigned, please understand our workflow:

1.  **Do not start work before being assigned.**
2.  **Wait for a maintainer to assign you.** A comment asking for the issue is not an assignment.
3.  **We reserve `women-devs-only` issues for women developers.** As our mission is to empower women in tech, we hold this space for them.

This process ensures fairness and helps us uphold our community's mission. Thank you for your understanding!
